          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Marg was born out of Dhemaji Engineering College by a group of engineering students who recognized a fundamental challenge: countless talented individuals struggle to find the exact career trajectory that matches their unique skills and ambitions.
          </p>

            By combining modern web technologies like the MERN stack with actionable industry insights, we set out to build a platform that doesn't just list jobs, but actively guides students toward their optimal professional paths. From mastering data structures to preparing for summer internships, we are building the roadmap we wish we had.
